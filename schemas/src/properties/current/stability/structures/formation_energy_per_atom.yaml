description: |-
  The computed formation energy of the structure, normalized by the number of atoms.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:
    - If present, this value MUST be computed using the relevant elemental chemical potentials.
    - In cases where a database has multiple fidelities of formation energy data, this value should somehow
      reflect the "best estimate" that is global for the database, i.e., the fidelity used for this field
      should not vary between entries in this database.
    - It is RECOMMENDED that additional database-specific metadata on this field is provided at the `/info/structures`
      endpoint that describes the calculation methods and approximations in full.
